Portland, Oregon, has drawn national attention recently for decriminalizing drugs as a means of combating substance abuse and addiction. This fundamental shift in drug policy signifies a move away from conventional tactics rooted in punishment and a move toward a more humane and focused approach to public health. Understanding the background of drug policy in the US is crucial to recognizing Portland's decision to decriminalize drugs. The 1970s saw the start of the "War on Drugs," which resulted in mass incarceration, harsh punishments, and an emphasis on law enforcement in public health. But as time went on, it became clear that this strategy was harmful, aggravating social inequality and disproportionately harming marginalized communities. After the War on Drugs failed to produce meaningful change for decades, Portland reviewed its drug policy. During the 2020 election cycle, to shift the focus from punishment to treatment and harm reduction, the city passed Measure 110, also referred to as the Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act. This measure decriminalized the possession of lesser amounts of drugs. The penal tactics that had long defined American drug policy were reversed with this action. Portland's decision to decriminalize drugs was influenced by the thought that drug use should become more of a public health issue than a criminal one. The city aimed to reallocate funds toward ensuring the availability of treatment and assistance for those grappling with addiction. Since harsh punishments often exacerbate the cycle of addiction without addressing its underlying causes, this approach placed a higher priority on harm reduction. For underprivileged communities, the effects of drug criminalization have been especially severe, perpetuating cycles of poverty and incarceration. Portland's move toward decriminalization is indicative of its dedication to equity and social justice. Decriminalizing drugs in Portland is a brave move that the city hopes will help to redefine the national dialogue on drug policy. The city wants to address substance use in a way that is more compassionate and successful by putting social justice and public health first. The city aims to end the cycle of systematic injustice that has disproportionately impacted minority communities.

Portland's decriminalization of drugs is an unusual and progressive approach, but it is not without difficulties. Decriminalization can increase drug use or endanger public safety. As seen in the graph above, the number of overdose deaths in Oregon practically doubled from 2019 to 2021. The rise in overdose deaths is alarming and something that should not be ignored. One reality is that eliminating the criminal penalties associated with drug possession can unintentionally lead to an increase in substance abuse. “we’ve seen more high-risk people such as alcoholics now doing drugs that didn’t do them before” says Natalie Martin, the Housing Program Manager at NARA NW, an agency in the Portland area that provides substance abuse treatment to marginalized communities. Now one may ask when reading this: Why Decriminalize? Well, the answer in short is that this is a system that has worked in other countries. One example of this is in in Portugal. Portugal decriminalized drug use at the turn of the Millenium in 2001, two decades later, they now have amongst the lowest rates of drug induced deaths in Europe as seen in the graph below.

The issue in Portland is not the fact that drugs are decriminalized but rather that there are not enough resources or people in place to help those seeking service. As mentioned above, the goal of this Measure was to shift the focus from punishment to rehabilitation, but this is where there are roadblocks. Martin says "It's a great idea, but we don't have enough resources, services are not readily available, it's not like you can go in and say Hey I need treatment. Because there might be a waiting list or something else. Even if people want to get help, they may not have access to it."

This is where the real issue is. Portland has had a well-known and documented issue with drug use, and Measure 110 can be helpful in mitigating these problems. They are following a proven model, However, for it to work they must also add more service centers. Outreach programs such as NARA NW are crucial to their communities, but they can only do so much. Portland has the potential to become Trail Blazers in American drug policy, but to fully realize the positive effects of drug decriminalization, a strong commitment to this new approach must be in addition to substantial investment in more public health service outlets. This should include mental health services, and addiction treatment centers. The city should also establish more safe consumption areas, where people can use drugs under supervision and lower the risk of lethal overdoses. A strong public awareness campaign could be another tool to inform the public about the purposes and effects of drug decriminalization. Portland can promote a more supportive environment for those seeking assistance by addressing concerns and dispelling myths, creating a better educated public. None of this is easy or cheap but tackling drug epidemics never is. It is difficult but Portland has a genuine chance at turning a corner in their story with drugs.
